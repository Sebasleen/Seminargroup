In this environment you can find the following folders:

1. Data
   I Contains all the relevant data in one folder
2. Full Code
    a. Full Code excl. PLS
        I Contains the code excluding the PLS improvement
    b. Full Code + PLS
        I Contains the code including the PLS improvement
3. Improvements
    a. Clustering Improvement
        I Contains the Clustering Data folder
        II The Elbow & Silhouette tests used to determine the optimal number of clusters
        III KMeans w. Clustering contains the full code for the Kmeans and clustering techniques.
    b. PLS Improvement
        I Contains the PLS code also used in the full code
4. Table 1
    I Contains the code for table 1 and the data
5. Table 2
    I Contains the code for table 2
6. Table 3
    I Contains the code for table 3 including all the relevant data
7. Table 4
    I Contains the code for table 4 including all the relevant data


All the codes should run without downloading additional datasets except for the Clustering code. Which requires the user to specify the path.
This is also explained within the Clustering code.
